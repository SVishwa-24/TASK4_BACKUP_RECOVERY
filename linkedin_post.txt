üõ°Ô∏è Just finished a robust DB Backup & Recovery setup ‚Äî automated, encrypted, and battle-tested.

What I built:
‚Ä¢ Full & incremental backups (MySQL / PostgreSQL)
‚Ä¢ Encrypted archives with GPG
‚Ä¢ Offsite sync to S3 (or any remote)
‚Ä¢ Automated verification (row counts + checksums)
‚Ä¢ Cron + rotation policy + retention + restore playbook

If you want the scripts (backup + restore + validation + cron config), DM me and I‚Äôll share the repo. #DataEngineering #DBA #Backup #DisasterRecovery
