Rollback Plan - Backup & Recovery

1) Pre-backup: take a full logical backup and store it securely.
   mysqldump -h MYSQL_HOST -u MYSQL_USER -pMYSQL_PASS --all-databases > mysql_pre_backup.sql

2) If restore is needed:
   - Decrypt and uncompress the chosen backup
   - Restore using mysql or psql commands depending on DB
   - Verify counts and run application smoke tests

3) Keep backups for at least 30 days before purging.
